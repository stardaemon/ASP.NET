    <p>
            Our company is aimed at immigration to the Mars. This can improve human activity scope and make full use of the resources on the Mars. At 
        the same time, it can be helpful to reduce the cost of resources on the Earth, because we can use our techonology to translate resources from the
        Mars. <br />
        <br />
            Well, some people will be nterested about the efficiency of our compony because of the distance. Acturally, we can provide a high efficiency 
        depending on our technique. As we know, the distance between the Mars and the Earth is between 55 million kilometers to 400 million kilometers. 
        Maybe it is too distance to many companys, but for us, we can travel between this two stars in a few weeks. This is our new technology and we believe
        we can make it better in the future.<br />
        <br />
            Another interesting thing is what we translating. From above describe, you may know that we can traslate resources between this two stars. Actually,
        we can also traslate people, or we wouldn't call ourselves as immigration.<br />
        <br />
            This is our company, and if you have other questions, you can go to the frequently asked questions or go to history to know our organisation's history.
